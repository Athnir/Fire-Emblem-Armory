# Raw Fates map data

Pre-processed source data for maps that haven't been built into `src/data/maps/` yet, so building
them later means reading these files instead of re-scraping. Nothing here is shipped in the app.

Sources: the [Fire Emblem Wiki](https://fireemblemwiki.org/) chapter pages and its
[Fates minimaps](https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Category:Fates_maps) (6 px per tile). No images are
stored, only data derived from them.

## `<route>/wiki/<NN>-<Page>.json`

Condensed from each chapter page:

- `victory`, `defeat`, `dims` ([width, height]), `items` (where each item comes from), `vein` (the
  Dragon Vein section, coordinates as the wiki writes them: **rows counted from the top**, so convert
  with `y = height + 1 - row`), `joins` (characters joining or recruitable).
- `initial[difficulty]`: `total` starting enemies (pairs count as two), `faction` (the generic
  enemies' name), and `rows`: only the entries that matter for a map — named units, item droppers
  (`drops`) and pair / position notes ("Stands on a throne", "Paired up together"...). Generic
  enemies without any of those aren't listed individually.
- `reinforcements[difficulty]`: how many arrive. `other`: NPC / allied units.

## `<route>/minimap/<NN>.json`

Read off the minimaps in the browser with the helpers in `scripts/minimap-tools.js`:

- `difficulty[d].red`: `"x,y": pixels` for every tile with an enemy dot (bottom-left is 1,1).
  4 = one unit, 8 = a pair-up; other counts are usually the boss glow bleeding onto a tile.
  `blue` = player starting tiles, `green` = allied NPCs, `glow` = boss-glow centres.
  A difficulty missing from the file uses the next easier one's image (no separate image exists).
- `changes[variant].tiles`: tiles that differ between the normal image and an after-vein (`dv`),
  bridge or traps image.
- `guess`: a first-pass terrain letter per tile (top row first; legend in the file of chapter 13).
  It's a starting point only: every map is checked by eye against its minimap when it's built.

`python scripts/check-raw-maps.py` checks every file parses, sizes match, and each census adds up to
the wiki's enemy total.

## Status

- Conquest 13–27 and Endgame: wiki + minimap data done (2026-10-08); first-pass build in
  `src/data/maps/conquestLate.ts` (2026-10-09), still to be gone over map by map.
- Built into the app: shared chapters (Prologue–5) and all of Conquest (6–Endgame).
